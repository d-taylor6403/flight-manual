# Keyboard Shortcuts

## Typing Speed
Improving your typing speed is essnetial to being a good software engineer. 

Some resources to consider: 

### Nitro Type - https://www.nitrotype.com/
Fun, race car themed application to test your typing speed. 

### Keybr - https://www.keybr.com/
Site designed to teach you "touch typing." No more "hunt-and-peck." 

### typing.io - https://typing.io/
The keys you use for coding are often different the keys commonly used when typing English. Your English typing speed typically drops by 30% when typing code. Get practice with specific syntax here. I recommend the JavaScript jQuery track.
